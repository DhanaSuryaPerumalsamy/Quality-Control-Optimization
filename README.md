The Elevate Textiles Finishing Plant has recently faced challenges, with an average of 8.31 defect points per 100 yards of fabric per week leading to increased production of off-quality rolls and significant financial losses. Consequently, the project was initiated with the mission of reducing off-quality production by 5% by identifying key defect categories and underlying trends, with the aim of achieving substantial cost savings. The approach involved analyzing defect data using statistical methods to pinpoint primary defect categories. This analysis focused on product attributes such as style, finish, and color to understand their relationship with defect occurrences. The project also entailed collaborative efforts among teams to analyze trends and establish recommendations for process improvements. Expected outcomes included the identification of primary defect categories, insights into the relationship between product attributes and defect occurrences, and data-driven recommendations for process improvements. The methodology involved utilizing JMP's fit Y by X models to analyze the relationship between product attributes and defect points, brainstorming potential relationships between product attributes and defect occurrences, and using time series analysis to understand temporal trends of defect occurrences and product attributes. Through leveraging statistical techniques and collaborative analysis, the project aimed to optimize quality control processes, minimize off-quality output and ensure profitability and customer satisfaction at Elevate Textiles Finishing Plant.
